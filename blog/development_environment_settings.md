In this tutorial, we will talk about how to setup a C++ environment for quantitative research and development. The covered topics are:

- Visual Studio Code, a text editor powered by extensions
  
- CMake, a cross platform building system for C/C++

- vcpkg, an open source C++ package manager

- git/github, a version control system

Prerequisits:

- Basic knowledge about the C++ programming language. Actually, it's OK even you know nothing about C++, just copy the example codes, hit to run, that's it. You can learn more about it later as you go deep as a quant developer.

- Basic knowledge about the terminal commands. For example, you should know how to execute commands from the terminal.

- Of course, as a quant developer, you should know at least something about financial derivatives.
